## Hidden

Hidden widgets are what you would expect, they render an `<input type="hidden">`.  This is the default for any layout item that can't be properly matched.  For the most part, hidden widgets won't be needed as you simply don't need to render them, their data never changes.  However, in the event that you need to do an actual form submittal, hidden inputs may be necessary and are therfore included.
